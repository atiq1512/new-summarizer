The Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation (MOSTI) has urged global players to consider Malaysia as a strategic entry point into Southeast Asia’s rapidly expanding digital economy. The country’s robust digital infrastructure and growing innovation ecosystem support collaboration across multinational companies, local businesses, universities and research institutions. 

MOSTI Minister Chang Lih Kang highlighted national artificial intelligence strategies, smart manufacturing programs and digital skills development as key initiatives positioning Malaysia as a hub for emerging technologies. He noted the newly launched AI World Experience Centre at i-City in Selangor strengthens Malaysia’s standing as a regional center for AI education and public engagement.

The centre aims to boost public-private collaboration and support upskilling and reskilling initiatives aligned with national priorities. It was developed through a partnership between China-based robotics company AgiBot and Malaysian developer I‑Berhad.

Situated in i‑City, the AI World Experience Centre is Southeast Asia’s first AI and robotics experience venue of its kind. The partnership also includes plans for AI Tower residences, envisioned as a space designed for living alongside AI and robotics technologies.

Chang said the centre could be replicated nationwide in partnership with industry and government, helping to decentralize digital opportunities to suburban and rural communities. Through interactive exhibits, robotics demonstrations and AI learning modules, the centre reflects the Malaysia MADANI vision of empowering society with innovation.

The launch coincides with Malaysia’s preparation to implement the National Artificial Intelligence Action Plan 2026–2030, further underscoring its role in shaping AI adoption and education in the region.
